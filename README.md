# Palindrome
#       Exercise by Websten from forums       #

A palindrome is a word or a phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards. 

Make a program that checks if a word is a palindrome. 
If the word is a palindrome, print 0 to the terminal,-1 otherwise. 
The word contains lowercase/upercase letters a-z/A-Z and will be at least one character long.
